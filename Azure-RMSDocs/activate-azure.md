# How to activate the Rights Management protection service from the Azure portal

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

>[!NOTE] 
> To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, **Azure Information Protection client (classic)** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

Use these instructions if you want to activate the Rights Management protection service (Azure RMS) from Azure Information Protection, by using the Azure portal.

1. If you haven't already done so, open a new browser window and [sign in to the Azure portal](configure-policy.md#signing-in-to-the-azure-portal). Then navigate to the **Azure Information Protection** pane.
    
    For example, in the search box for resources, services, and docs: Start typing **Information** and select **Azure Information Protection**.
    
    If you haven't accessed the Azure Information Protection pane before, see the one-time [additional steps](configure-policy.md#to-access-the-azure-information-protection-pane-for-the-first-time) to add this pane to the portal.
    
    To open the Azure Information Protection pane, you must have either an [Azure Information Protection Premium plan](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-pricing) or an [Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf). If you have one of these subscriptions but see a message that a valid subscription cannot be found, [contact Microsoft Support](information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support) or use your standard support channels.

2. Locate the **Manage** menu options, and select **Protection activation**. 
    
    Click **Activate**, and then confirm your action. 

When activation is complete, the information bar displays **Activation finished successfully**.
