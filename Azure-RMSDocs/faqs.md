Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

Have a question about Azure Information Protection, or about the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS)? See if it's answered here.

## What's the difference between Azure Information Protection and Microsoft Information Protection?

Unlike Azure Information Protection, [Microsoft Information Protection](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection) isn't a subscription or product that you can buy. Instead, it's a framework for products and integrated capabilities that help you protect your organization's sensitive information.

**Microsoft Information Protection products include:**
- Azure Information Protection
- Microsoft 365 Information Protection, such as Microsoft 365 DLP
- Windows Information Protection
- Microsoft Cloud App Security

**Microsoft Information Protection capabilities include:**
- Unified label management
- End-user labeling experiences built into Office apps
- The ability for Windows to understand unified labels and apply protection to data
- The Microsoft Information Protection SDK
- Functionality in Adobe Acrobat Reader to view labeled and protected PDFs

For more information, see [Information protection capabilities to help protect your sensitive data](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Enterprise-Mobility-Security/Announcing-availability-of-information-protection-capabilities/ba-p/261967).

## What's the difference between labels in Azure Information Protection and labels in Office 365?

Originally, Microsoft 365 had just [retention labels](https://support.office.com/article/af398293-c69d-465e-a249-d74561552d30) that enabled you to classify documents and emails for auditing and retention when that content was stored in Microsoft 365 services. 

In contrast, Azure Information Protection labels enabled you apply a consistent classification and protection policy for documents and emails whether they were stored on-premises or in the cloud.

Announced at Microsoft Ignite 2018 in Orlando, Microsoft 365 now has the option to create and configure [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels), in addition to retention labels. Sensitivity labels can be created and configured in the following admin centers:

- Office 365 Security & Compliance Center
- Microsoft 365 security center
- Microsoft 365 compliance center

Use Azure Information Protection labels as sensitivity labels with Microsoft 365 apps by [migrating your AIP labels to the unified labeling store](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md).

For more information about unified labeling management and support, see [Announcing availability of information protection capabilities to help protect your sensitive data](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Enterprise-Mobility-Security/Announcing-availability-of-information-protection-capabilities/ba-p/261967).

## How can I determine if my tenant is on the unified labeling platform?

When your tenant is on the unified labeling platform, it supports sensitivity labels that can be used by [clients and services that support unified labeling](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#clients-and-services-that-support-unified-labeling). If you obtained your subscription for Azure Information Protection in June 2019 or later, your tenant is automatically on the unified labeling platform and no further action is needed. Your tenant might also be on this platform because somebody migrated your Azure Information Protection labels.

If your tenant is not on the unified labeling platform, you'll see the following information banner in the Azure portal, on the **Azure Information Protection** panes:

![Migration information banner](media/migration-status-banner.png)

You can also check by going to **Azure Information Protection** > **Manage** > **Unified labeling**, and view the **Unified labeling** status:

|Status |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Activated**     |  Your tenant is on the unified labeling platform. </br>You can [create, configure, and publish labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels) from the Microsoft 365 compliance center.       |
|**Not activated**    |  Your tenant is not on the unified labeling platform. </br>For migration instructions and guidance, see [How to migrate Azure Information Protection labels to unified sensitivity labels](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md).       |

## What's the difference between the Azure Information Protection classic and unified labeling clients?

The original client, referred to as the *Azure Information client* or the *classic* client, downloads labels and policy settings from Azure and enables you to configure the [AIP policy](overview-policy.md) from the Azure portal.

The *unified labeling client* is a more recent addition and supports the unified labeling store used by multiple applications and services. The unified labeling client downloads [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) and policy settings from the following admin centers:

- Office 365 Security & Compliance Center
- Microsoft 365 security center
- Microsoft 365 compliance center

If you're an admin and aren't sure which client to use, see [Choose which Azure Information Protection client to use](./rms-client/use-client.md#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use-for-windows-computers).

### Identify the client you have installed

If you are a user who wants to understand verify whether you have the classic or unified labeling client installed, select **Help and Feedback** to show the **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** dialog box. 

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/client-about.png" alt-text="Identify whether you have the classic or unified client installed":::

The version number indicates the client, as follows:

- Versions **1.x** indicate that you have the classic client. Example: **1.54.59.0**
- Versions **2.x** indicate that you have the unified labeling client. Example: **2.6.111.0**

Access this dialog using one of the following methods:

- In the File Explorer, right-click a file, files, or folder, select **Classify and protect** > **Help and Feedback**.
- In Office applications, the classic client has a **Protect** button, and the unified labeling client has a **Sensitivity** button. Select either of these buttons and then select **Help and Feedback**.

## When is the right time to migrate my labels?

We recommend that you migrate your Azure Information Protection labels to the unified labeling platform so that you can use them as sensitivity labels with other [clients and services that support unified labeling](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#clients-and-services-that-support-unified-labeling).

For more information and instructions, see [How to migrate Azure Information Protection labels to unified sensitivity labels](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md).

## After I've migrated my labels, which management portal do I use?

After you've migrated your labels in the Azure portal, continue managing them in one of the following locations, depending on the clients you have installed:

|Client  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[Unified labeling clients and services](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#clients-and-services-that-support-unified-labeling) only    |  If you only have unified labeling clients installed, manage your labels in one of the admin centers: Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Microsoft 365 security center, or Microsoft 365 compliance center. Unified labeling clients download the labels and policy settings from these admin centers. </br></br>For instructions, see [Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels).     |
|[Classic client](./rms-client/aip-client.md) only  | If you've migrated your labels, but still have the classic client installed, continue to use the Azure portal to edit labels and policy settings. The classic client continues to download labels and policy settings from Azure.
|Both the AIP [classic client](./rms-client/aip-client.md) and [unified labeling](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#clients-and-services-that-support-unified-labeling) clients     | If you have both of the clients installed, use the admin centers or the Azure portal to make label changes. </br></br>For the classic clients to pick up label changes made in the admin centers, return to the Azure portal to publish them. In the Azure portal > **Azure Information Protection - Unified labeling** pane, select **Publish**.  </br></br> Continue to use the Azure portal for [central reporting](reports-aip.md) and the [scanner](deploy-aip-scanner.md).     |
| | |

## Do I need to re-encrypt my files after moving to sensitivity labels and the unified labeling platform?

No, you don’t need to re-encrypt your files after moving to sensitivity labels and the unified labeling platform after migrating from the AIP classic client and the labels managed in the Azure portal.

After migrating, manage your labels and labeling policies from your labeling admin center, including the Microsoft security center, Microsoft compliance center, or the Microsoft Security & Compliance Center. 

For more information, see [Learn about sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) in the Microsoft 365 documentation and the [Understanding unified labeling migration](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/understanding-unified-labeling-migration/ba-p/783185) blog.


## What's the difference between Azure Information Protection and Azure Rights Management?

Azure Information Protection (AIP) provides classification, labeling, and protection for an organization's documents and emails.

Content is protected using the Azure Rights Management service, which is now a component of AIP. 

For more information, see [How data is protected](what-is-information-protection.md#how-aip-protects-your-data) and [What is Azure Rights Management?](what-is-azure-rms.md).

## What's the role of identity management for Azure Information Protection?

Identity management is an important component of AIP, as users must have a valid user name and password to access protected content.

To read more about how Azure Information Protection helps to secure your data, see [The role of Azure Information Protection in securing data](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/azure-information-protection-securing-data). 

## What subscription do I need for Azure Information Protection and what features are included?

To understand more about AIP subscriptions, see the subscription information and feature list on the [Azure Information Protection pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection) page.

If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription that includes Azure Rights Management data protection, download the [Azure Information Protection licensing datasheet](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf) for more details about integrating with AIP.

Still have questions about licensing? See if they are answered in the [frequently asked questions for licensing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection#faq) section.

## Is the Azure Information Protection client only for subscriptions that include classification and labeling?

No. The classic AIP client can also be used with subscriptions that include just the Azure Rights Management service, for data protection only.

When the classic client is installed without an Azure Information Protection policy, the client automatically operates in [protection-only mode](./rms-client/client-protection-only-mode.md), which enables users to apply Rights Management templates and custom permissions. 

If you later purchase a subscription that does include classification and labeling, the client automatically switches to standard mode when it downloads the Azure Information Protection policy.

## Do you need to be a global admin to configure Azure Information Protection, or can I delegate to other administrators?

Global administrators for a Microsoft 365 tenant or Azure AD tenant can obviously run all administrative tasks for Azure Information Protection. 

However, if you want to assign administrative permissions to other users, do so using the following roles:

- [Azure Information Protection administrator](#azure-information-protection-administrator)
- [Compliance administrator or Compliance data administrator](#compliance-administrator-or-compliance-data-administrator)
- [Security reader or Global reader](#security-reader-or-global-reader)
- [Security administrator](#security-administrator)
- [Azure Rights Management Global Administrator and Connector Administrator](#azure-rights-management-global-administrator-and-connector-administrator)

Additionally, note the following when managing administrative tasks and roles:

|Topic  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|**Supported account types**     | Microsoft accounts are not supported for delegated administration of Azure Information Protection, even if these accounts are assigned to one of the administrative roles listed.         |
|**Onboarding controls**     |If you have configured [onboarding controls](activate-service.md#configuring-onboarding-controls-for-a-phased-deployment), this configuration does not affect the ability to administer Azure Information Protection, except the RMS connector. </br></br>For example, if you have configured onboarding controls so that the ability to protect content is restricted to the *IT department* group, the account used to install and configure the RMS connector must be a member of that group.          |
|**Removing protection**     |  Administrators cannot automatically remove protection from documents or emails that were protected by Azure Information Protection. </br></br>Only users who are assigned as super users can do remove protection, and only when the super user feature is enabled. </br></br>Any user with administrative permissions to Azure Information Protection can enable the super user feature, and assign users as super users, including their own account. </br></br>These actions are recorded in an administrator log. </br></br>For more information, see the security best practices section in [Configuring super users for Azure Information Protection and discovery services or data recovery](configure-super-users.md). 
       |
|**Migrating to the unified labeling store**      |  If you are migrating your Azure Information Protection labels to the unified labeling store, be sure to read the following section from the label migration documentation: </br>[Administrative roles that support the unified labeling platform](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#administrative-roles-that-support-the-unified-labeling-platform).
       |

### Azure Information Protection administrator

This Azure Active Directory administrator role lets an administrator configure Azure Information Protection but not other services. 

Administrators with this role can:

- Activate and deactivate the Azure Rights Management protection service
- Configure protection settings and labels
- Configure the Azure Information Protection policy
- Run all the PowerShell cmdlets for the [Azure Information Protection client](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-powershell.md) and from the [AIPService module](administer-powershell.md)
    
To assign a user to this administrative role, see [Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal).

> [!NOTE]
> This role doesn't support tracking and revoking documents for users, and is not supported in the Azure portal if your tenant is on the [unified labeling platform](#how-can-i-determine-if-my-tenant-is-on-the-unified-labeling-platform).
    
### Compliance administrator or Compliance data administrator

These Azure Active Directory administrator roles enable administrators to:

- Configure Azure Information Protection, including activating and deactivating the Azure Rights Management protection service
- Configure protection settings and labels
- Configure the Azure Information Protection policy
- Run all the PowerShell cmdlets for the [Azure Information Protection client](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-powershell.md) and from the [AIPService module](administer-powershell.md). 

To assign a user to this administrative role, see [Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal). 

To see what other permissions a user with these roles have, see the [Available roles](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal#available-roles) section from the Azure Active Directory documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> These roles don't support tracking and revoking documents for users.
>     
    
### Security reader or Global reader

These roles are used for [Azure Information Protection analytics](reports-aip.md) only, and enable administrators to:

- View how your labels are being used
- Monitor user access to labeled documents and emails
- View changes made to classification
- Identify documents that contain sensitive information that must be protected 

Because this feature uses Azure Monitor, you must also have a supporting [RBAC role](reports-aip.md#permissions-required-for-azure-information-protection-analytics).

### Security administrator

This Azure Active Directory administrator role enables administrators to configure Azure Information Protection in the Azure portal as well as some aspects of other Azure services. 

Administrators with this role cannot run any of the [PowerShell cmdlets from the AIPService module](administer-powershell.md), or track and revoke documents for users.
    
To assign a user to this administrative role, see [Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal). 

To see what other permissions a user with this role has, see the [Available roles](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal#available-roles) section from the Azure Active Directory documentation.

### Azure Rights Management Global Administrator and Connector Administrator

The Global Administrator role enables users to run all [PowerShell cmdlets from the AIPService module](administer-powershell.md) without making them a global administrator for other cloud services.

The Connector Administrator role enables users to run only the Rights Management (RMS) connector. 

These administrative roles don't grant permissions to management consoles, or support tracking and revoking documents for users.
    
To assign either of these administrative roles, use the AIPService PowerShell cmdlet, [Add-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator](/powershell/module/aipservice/add-aipservicerolebasedadministrator).

## Does Azure Information Protection support on-premises and hybrid scenarios?

Yes. Although Azure Information Protection is a cloud-based solution, it can classify, label, and protect documents and emails that are stored on-premises, as well as in the cloud.

If you have Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, and Windows file servers, use one or both of the following methods:

- Deploy the [Rights Management connector](deploy-rms-connector.md) so that these on-premises servers can use the Azure Rights Management service to protect your emails and documents
- Synchronize and federate your Active Directory domain controllers with Azure AD for a more seamless authentication experience for users. For example, use [Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect).

The Azure Rights Management service automatically generates and manages XrML certificates as required, so it doesn't use an on-premises PKI. 

For more information about how Azure Rights Management uses certificates, see the [Walkthrough of how Azure RMS works: First use, content protection, content consumption](./how-does-it-work.md#walkthrough-of-how-azure-rms-works-first-use-content-protection-content-consumption).

## What types of data can Azure Information Protection classify and protect?

Azure Information Protection can classify and protect email messages and documents, whether they are located on-premises or in the cloud. These documents include Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDF documents, text-based files, and image files. 

For more information, see the full list [file types supported](./rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-file-types.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Information Protection cannot classify and protect structured data such as database files, calendar items, Yammer posts, Sway content, and OneNote notebooks.
> 

> [!TIP]
> Power BI now supports classification by using sensitivity labels and can apply protection from those labels to data that is exported to the following file formats: .pdf, .xls, and .ppt. For more information, see [Data protection in Power BI](/power-bi/admin/service-security-data-protection-overview).
> 
## I see Azure Information Protection is listed as an available cloud app for conditional access—how does this work?

Yes, as a preview offering, you can now configure Azure AD conditional access for Azure Information Protection.

When a user opens a document that is protected by Azure Information Protection, administrators can now block or grant access to users in their tenant, based on the standard conditional access controls. Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) is one of the most commonly requested conditions. Another one is that devices must be [compliant with your Intune policies](/intune/protect/conditional-access-intune-common-ways-use) so that for example, mobile devices meet your password requirements and a minimum operating system version, and computers must be domain-joined.

For more information and some walk-through examples, see the following blog post: [Conditional Access policies for Azure Information Protection](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/10/17/conditional-access-policies-for-azure-information-protection/).

Additional information:

|Topic  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|**Evaluation frequency**    | For Windows computers, and the current preview release, the conditional access policies for Azure Information Protection are evaluated when the [user environment is initialized](./how-does-it-work.md#initializing-the-user-environment) (this process is also known as bootstrapping), and then every 30 days.</br></br>To fine-tune how often your conditional access policies get evaluated, [configure the token lifetime](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes).       |
|**Administrator accounts**     |We recommend that you do not add administrator accounts to your conditional access policies because these accounts will not be able to access the Azure Information Protection pane in the Azure portal.         |
|**MFA and B2B collaboration**     | If you use MFA in your conditional access policies for collaborating with other organizations (B2B), you must use [Azure AD B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/b2b/what-is-b2b) and create guest accounts for the users you want to share with in the other organization.        |
|**Terms of Use prompts**     |  With the Azure AD December 2018 preview release, you can now [prompt users to accept a terms of use](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Updates-to-Azure-AD-Terms-of-Use-functionality-within/ba-p/294822) before they open a protected document for the first time.       |
|**Cloud apps**     |  If you use many cloud apps for conditional access, you might not see **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** displayed in the list to select. </br></br>In this case, use the search box at the top of the list. Start typing "Microsoft Azure Information Protection" to filter the available apps. Providing you have a supported subscription, you'll then see **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** to select.        |


## I see Azure Information Protection is listed as a security provider for Microsoft Graph Security—how does this work and what alerts will I receive?

Yes, as a public preview offering, you can now receive an alert for **Azure Information Protection anomalous data access**. This alert is triggered when there are unusual attempts to access data that is protected by Azure Information Protection. For example, accessing an unusually high volume of data, at an unusual time of day, or access from an unknown location.

Such alerts can help you to detect advanced data-related attacks and insider threats in your environment. These alerts use machine learning to profile the behavior of users who access your protected data. 

The Azure Information Protection alerts can be accessed by [using the Microsoft Graph Security API](/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview), or you can [stream alerts](/graph/security-integration) to SIEM solutions, such as Splunk and IBM Qradar, by using Azure Monitor.

For more information about the Microsoft Graph Security API, see [Microsoft Graph Security API overview](/graph/security-concept-overview).

## What's the difference between Windows Server FCI and the Azure Information Protection scanner?

Windows Server File Classification Infrastructure has historically been an option to classify documents and then protect them by using the [Rights Management connector](deploy-rms-connector.md) (Office documents only) or a [PowerShell script](./rms-client/configure-fci.md) (all file types). 

We now recommend you use the [Azure Information Protection scanner](deploy-aip-scanner.md). The scanner uses the Azure Information Protection client and your Azure Information Protection policy to label documents (all file types) so that these documents are then classified and optionally, protected.

The main differences between these two solutions:

|  |Windows Server FCI  |Azure Information Protection scanner  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Supported data stores**    | Local folders on Windows Server        | - Windows file shares and network-attached storage<br /></br>- SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2013. SharePoint Server 2010 is also supported for customers who have [extended support for this version of SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search?alpha=SharePoint%20Server%202010).        |
|**Operational mode**     |Real time         |Systematically crawls the data stores once or repeatedly         |
|**Supported file types**     | - All file types are protected by default <br /><br />- Specific file types can be excluded from protection by editing the registry|Support for file types: <br /><br />- Office file types and PDF documents are protected by default <br /><br />- Additional file types can be included for protection by editing the registry|

### Setting Rights Management owners

By default, for both Windows Server FCI and the Azure Information Protection scanner, the [Rights Management owner](configure-usage-rights.md#rights-management-issuer-and-rights-management-owner) is set to the account that protects the file.

Override the default settings as follows:

- **Windows Server FCI**: Set the Rights Management owner to be a single account for all files, or dynamically set the Rights Management owner for each file. 

    To dynamically set the Rights Management owner, use the **-OwnerMail [Source File Owner Email]** parameter and value. This configuration retrieves the user's email address from Active Directory by using the user account name in the file's Owner property.

- **Azure Information Protection scanner:** For newly protected files, set the Rights Management owner to be a single account for all files on a specified data store, by specifying the **-Default owner** setting in the scanner profile. 

    Dynamically setting the Rights Management owner for each file is not supported, and the Rights Management owner is not changed for previously protected files. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > When the scanner protects files on SharePoint sites and libraries, the Rights Management owner is dynamically set for each file by using the SharePoint Editor value.

## I've heard a new release is going to be available soon, for Azure Information Protection—when will it be released?

The technical documentation does not contain information about upcoming releases. For this type of information, use the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?&filters=Azure%20Information%20Protection%2CO365%20Information%20Protection#owRoadmapMainContent), check the [Enterprise Mobility + Security Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Enterprise-Mobility-Security/bg-p/enterprisemobilityandsecurity?product=azure-information-protection,azure-rights-management-services).
