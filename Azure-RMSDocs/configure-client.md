# Azure Information Protection client: Installation and configuration for clients

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

>[!NOTE]
> To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, **Azure Information Protection client (classic)** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

Computers running Office 2010 require either the Azure Information Protection client (classic) or the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client to authenticate to the Azure Information Protection service.

Not sure of the difference between these two clients?  See [What's the difference between the Azure Information Protection client and the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client?](faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-azure-information-protection-and-microsoft-information-protection)

These clients are also recommended for all Windows computers because they install an Office add-in so that users can easily label and protect documents and emails directly from the Office ribbon. These clients also offer labeling and protection for files types that are not natively supported by the protection service (Azure Rights Management), and a viewer for protected files that can't be opened by Office apps. There's a similar viewer for iOS and Android.

The classic client also supports a document tracking site for users to track and revoke files that they have protected.

## The Azure Information Protection client for Windows: Installation and configuration

For an enterprise installation and configuration of the client for Windows, see the following admin guides:

- Unified labeling client: [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client administrator guide](./rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide.md)](./rms-client/client-admin-guide.md)

- Classic client: [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](./rms-client/client-admin-guide.md)

However, if you want to quickly install and test these clients for a single computer, see the following instructions from the user guides:

- Unified labeling client: [Download and install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](./rms-client/install-unifiedlabelingclient-app.md)

- Classic client: [Download and install the Azure Information Protection client](./rms-client/install-client-app.md) from the [Azure Information Protection client user guide](./rms-client/client-user-guide.md).

## The Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android: Installation and management

To install the Azure Information Protection app viewer for iOS and Android, use the links on the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970). No configuration is required.

> [!NOTE]
> For Mac computers, links from this page download the RMS sharing app. These computers do not support the Azure Information Protection client.

### Integration with Intune

Because the Azure Information Protection viewer app uses the Microsoft Intune App Software Development Kit, when iOS and Android devices are enrolled by Intune, you can deploy and manage the Azure Information Protection viewer app for these devices:

1. [Add the Azure Information Protection app to Intune](/intune/apps/apps-add)

2. Do one or both of the following actions:

    - Deploy the app by [assigning it to users](/intune/apps/apps-deploy)

    - Manage the app by using [app protection policies](/intune/apps/app-protection-policies)

Additional information for when you add the Azure Information Protection app to Intune:

- For iOS: Search for and add the app from Intune.

- For Android: When you add the app, use the following **Appstore URL**:

    ```md
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.ipviewer
    ```

When the Azure Information Protection app is configured for an app protection policy for Android devices, in addition to opening protected text, images, and PDF documents, this app can also open audio and video files. For more information, see [View media files with the Azure Information Protection app](/intune/fundamentals/end-user-mam-apps-android#view-media-files-with-the-azure-information-protection-app).

## Next steps

After you have installed and configured Azure Information Protection clients, you might need to learn more about how the client interprets the different usage rights that can be used to protect documents and emails. For more information, see [Configuring usage rights for Azure Information Management](configure-usage-rights.md).
