# Getting started with tenant root keys

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

After planning, creating, and configuring your tenant key as needed, continue with the following steps:

- [Start using your tenant key](#start-using-your-tenant-key)
- [Consider usage logging](#consider-usage-logging)

For more information about the life-cycle operations supported for your tenant key, see [Operations for your Azure Information Protection tenant key](./operations-tenant-key.md).

> [!TIP]
> If your organization requires on-premises protection for highly sensitive content, configure either [HYOK protection](configure-adrms-restrictions.md) (classic clients only), or [DKE protection](plan-implement-tenant-key.md#double-key-encryption-dke-aip-unified-labeling-client-only) (unified labeling client only).
> 

## Start using your tenant key

Activate the Rights Management service if it's not yet activated, to enable your organization to start using Azure Information Protection. Users immediately start to use your tenant key.

For more information, see [Activating the protection service from Azure Information Protection](./activate-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you decided to manage your own tenant key after the Rights Management service was activated, users are gradually transitioned from the old key to the new key over the course of a few weeks.
>
>During this transition, documents and files that were protected with the old tenant key remain accessible to authorized users.

## Consider usage logging

Usage logging logs every transaction that the Azure Rights Management service performs.

Depending on your key management method, logging information may include details about your tenant key. The following image shows an example from a log file displayed in Excel, where the **KeyVaultDecryptRequest** and **KeyVaultSignRequest** request types show that the tenant key is being used.
