>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012*
>
>*If you have Windows 7 or Office 2010, see [AIP for Windows and Office versions in extended support](../known-issues.md#aip-for-windows-and-office-versions-in-extended-support).*
>
> *Instructions for: [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients)*

Before you install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client on your enterprise network, check that computers have the required operating system versions and applications for Azure Information Protection: [Requirements for Azure Information Protection](../requirements.md). 

Then check the additional prerequisites that might be needed for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, as documented in the next section. Not all the prerequisites are checked by the installation program.

## Additional prerequisites for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client

The following prerequisites for the AIP unified labeling client are in addition to items listed in [Azure Information Protection requirements](../requirements.md).

|Requirement  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2**     | The full installation of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client by default, requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2. </br></br>If this framework is missing, the setup wizard from the executable installer tries to download and install this prerequisite. When this prerequisite is installed as part of the client installation, the computer must be restarted.       |
|**Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2**     | If the Azure Information Protection Viewer is installed separately, the Viewer application requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2. </br></br>**Important:** If this framework is missing for the Viewer, the executable installer does *not* download or install it.        |
|**Windows PowerShell minimum version 4.0**     |   The PowerShell module for the client requires a minimum version of Windows PowerShell 4.0, which might need to be installed on older operating systems. </br></br>For more information, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell 4.0](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx). </br></br>**Important:** The installer does *not* check or install this prerequisite for you. To confirm the version of Windows PowerShell that you are running, type `$PSVersionTable` in a PowerShell session.      |
|**Screen resolution greater than 800x600**    |     Resolutions 800x600 and lower can't fully display the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box when you right-click a file or folder in File Explorer.    |
|**Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant 7.250.4303.0**     |   Computers running Office 2010 require Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant version 7.250.4303.0, which is included with the client installation. </br></br>If you have a later version of the Sign-in Assistant, uninstall it before you install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client. </br></br>For example, check the version and uninstall the Sign-in Assistant by using **Control Panel** > **Program and Features** > **Uninstall or change a program**.      |
|**KB 4482887**     | For Windows 10 version 1809 only, operation system builds older than 17763.348, install [March 1, 2019â€”KB4482887 (OS Build 17763.348)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4482887/windows-10-update-kb4482887) to ensure the Information Protection bar displays correctly in Office applications. </br></br>This update is not needed if you have Office 365 1902 or later.        |
|**Admin permissions**| Installing the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client requires local administrative permissions.| 
|**Disable Exploit protection**   |The AIP client is not supported on machines that have [Exploit protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/enable-exploit-protection) enabled. Make sure to [disable Exploit protection](../known-issues.md#known-issues-for-installing-the-aip-client) before installing the AIP client.  |
|||
        
### Configure your group policy to prevent disabling AIP

For Office versions 2013 and later, we recommend that you configure your group policy to ensure that the **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** add-in for Office applications is always enabled.  Without this add-in, users won't be able to label their documents or emails in Office applications.   

- **For Outlook:** Use the group policy setting documented in [System Administrator control over add-ins](/office/vba/outlook/concepts/getting-started/support-for-keeping-add-ins-enabled#system-administrator-control-over-add-ins).
- **For Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:** Use the group policy setting **list of managed add-ins** documented in [No Add-ins loaded due to group policy settings for Office 2013 and Office 2016 programs](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2733070/no-add-ins-loaded-due-to-group-policy-settings-for-office-2013-and-off). . 

    Specify the following programmatic identifiers (ProgID) for AIP, and set the option to **1: The add-in is always enabled**.

    |Application  |ProgID  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Word     |     `MSIP.WordAddin`    |
    |Excel     |  `MSIP.ExcelAddin`       |
    |PowerPoint     |   `MSIP.PowerPointAddin`      |
    | | | 

## Applications

The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client can label and protect documents and emails by using the Office applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook from any of the following Office editions:

- Office apps minimum version 1805, build 9330.2078 from Microsoft 365 Apps for Business or Microsoft 365 Business Premium when the user is assigned a license for Azure Rights Management (also known as Azure Information Protection for Office 365)
- Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise
- Office Professional Plus 2019
- Office Professional Plus 2016
- Office Professional Plus 2013 with Service Pack 1
- Office Professional Plus 2010 with Service Pack 2

Other editions (such as **standard**) of Office cannot protect documents and emails by using a Rights Management service. For these editions, Azure Information Protection is supported for **labeling** only. Consequently, labels that apply protection do not display to users on the Azure Information Protection Sensitivity button or bar.

For information about which Office editions support the protection service, see [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](../requirements-applications.md).

### Office features and capabilities not supported

The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client does not support multiple versions of Office on the same computer, or switching user accounts in Office.

The Office mail merge feature is not supported with any Azure Information Protection feature.

## Options to install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for users

There are two options for installing the client for users:

**Run the executable (.exe) version of the client**: The recommended installation method that you can run interactively, or silently. This method has the most flexibility and it is recommended because the installer checks for many of the prerequisites, and can automatically install missing prerequisites. [Instructions](#to-install-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client-by-using-the-executable-installer)

**Deploy the Windows installer (.msi) version of the client**: Supported for silent installs only that use a central deployment mechanism, such as group policy, Configuration Manager, and Microsoft Intune. This method is necessary for Windows 10 PCs that are managed by Intune and mobile device management (MDM) because for these computers, executable files are not supported for installation. However, when you use this installation method, you must manually check and install or uninstall the dependent software that the installer for the executable would perform for each computer. [Instructions](#to-install-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client-by-using-the-msi-installer)

After the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is installed, you can update this client by repeating your chosen installation method, or use Windows Update to keep the client automatically upgraded. For more information about upgrading, see the [Upgrading and maintaining the Azure Information Protection client](clientv2-admin-guide.md#upgrading-and-maintaining-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client) section.

### To install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client by using the executable installer

Use the following instructions to install the client when you're not using the Microsoft Update catalog, or deploying the .msi by using a central deployment method such as Intune.

1. Download the executable version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client (file name of AzInfoProtection_UL) from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018). 
    
    If there is a preview version available, keep this version for testing only. It is not intended for end users in a production environment. 

2. For a default installation, simply run the executable, for example, **AzInfoProtection_UL.exe**. However, to see the installation options, first run the executable with **/help**: `AzInfoProtection_UL.exe /help`

    Example to silently install the client: `AzInfoProtection_UL.exe /quiet`
    
    Example to silently install only the PowerShell cmdlets: `AzInfoProtection_UL.exe  PowerShellOnly=true /quiet`
    
    Additional parameters that are not listed on the help screen:
    
    - **ServiceLocation**: Use this parameter if you are installing the client on computers that run Office 2010 and your users are not local administrators on their computers or you do not want them to be prompted. [More information](#more-information-about-the-servicelocation-installation-parameter) 
    
    - **AllowTelemetry=0**: Use this parameter to disable the install option **Help improve Azure Information Protection by sending usage statistics to Microsoft**. 

3. To complete the installation: 

    - If your computer runs Office 2010, restart your computer. 
        
        If the client was not installed with the ServiceLocation parameter, when you first open one of the Office applications that use the Azure Information Protection unified client (for example, Word), you must confirm any prompts to update the registry for this first-time use. [Service discovery](client-deployment-notes.md#rms-service-discovery) is used to populate the registry keys. 
    
    - For other versions of Office, restart any Office applications and all instances of File Explorer. 
        
5. You can confirm that the installation was successful by checking the install log file, which by default is created in the %temp% folder. You can change this location with the **/log** installation parameter. 
 
    This file has the following naming format: `Microsoft_Azure_Information_Protection_<number>_<number>_MSIP.Setup.Main.msi.log`
    
    For example: **Microsoft_Azure_Information_Protection_20161201093652_000_MSIP.Setup.Main.msi.log**
    
    In this log file, search for the following string: **Product: Microsoft Azure Information Protection -- Installation completed successfully.** If the installation failed, this log file contains details to help you identify and resolve any problems.

#### More information about the ServiceLocation installation parameter

When you install the client for users who have Office 2010 and they do not have local administrative permissions, specify the ServiceLocation parameter and the URL for your Azure Rights Management service. This parameter and value creates and sets the following registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\Activation

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\EnterprisePublishing

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\EnterprisePublishing

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\Activation

Use the following procedure to identify the value to specify for the ServiceLocation parameter. 

##### To identify the value to specify for the ServiceLocation parameter

1. From a PowerShell session, first run [Connect-AipService](/powershell/module/aipservice/connect-aipservice) and specify your administrator credentials to connect to the Azure Rights Management service. Then run [Get-AipServiceConfiguration](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipserviceconfiguration). 
 
    If you haven't already installed the PowerShell module for the Azure Rights Management service, see [Installing the AIPService PowerShell module](../install-powershell.md).

2. From the output, identify the **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl** value.

    For example: **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl   : https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/licensing**

3. From the value, remove **/_wmcs/licensing** from this string. For example: **https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com**

    The remaining string is the value to specify for your ServiceLocation parameter.

Example to install the client silently for Office 2010 and Azure RMS: `AzInfoProtection_UL.exe /quiet ServiceLocation=https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com`


### To install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client by using the .msi installer

For central deployment, use the following information that is specific to the .msi installation version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client. 

If you use Intune for your software deployment method, use these instructions together with [Add apps with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add).

1. Download the .msi version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client (AzInfoProtection_UL) from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018). 
    
    If there is a preview version available, keep this version for testing only. It is not intended for end users in a production environment.

1. For each computer that runs the .msi file, you must make sure that the following software dependencies are in place. For example, package these with the .msi version of the client or only deploy to computers that meet these dependencies:
