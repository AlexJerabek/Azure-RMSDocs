# What is the Azure Information Protection app for iOS or Android?

*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

The Azure Information Protection (AIP) mobile app for iOS and Android is a viewer app that enables you to view protected email messages, PDFs, images, and text files, and are useful if your regular apps for these file types do not support protection. 

For example, if protected emails show in your regular email mobile app as attachments, you may want to use the AIP mobile app to view that email.

For more information, see [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](../requirements-applications.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The AIP mobile apps are *viewers only,* and do not enable you to create new emails or reply to emails, or create or edit protected files. The AIP mobile apps also cannot open attachments to protected PDFs or emails.

## Admins: Testing the AIP mobile apps

Most users will typically use the AIP mobile app to open a protected email or file that cannot be opened using their regular mobile apps.

If you're a system administrator who wants to test the AIP mobile apps for your org, or simply want to try it out for yourself, use the instructions below to walk you through the entire process.

1. Make sure that you have access to a file type supported by the AIP mobile app from your device. 

    For example, send yourself one of the following rights-protected files:

    |File type  |Instructions  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Email (.rpmsg)**     | Use another device, such as Outlook from a Windows computer, to send yourself a rights-protected email message that you can access from your mobile device.  |
    |**PDF**     | 1. From a Windows computer, protect a PDF file using the AIP [classic](client-classify-protect.md) or [unified labeling](clientv2-classify-protect.md) client. </br>2. Send yourself the protected PDF, or upload it to a SharePoint protected library and share it to your own email address.        |
    |**Image (.ptxt, .pjpg, or .ppng)**     | 1. From a Windows computer, protect a text or image file using the AIP [classic](client-classify-protect.md) or [unified labeling](clientv2-classify-protect.md) client. </br></br>2. Send yourself the protected file, or upload it to a SharePoint protected library and share it to your own email address.   |
| | |

1. Open the protected file on your mobile device using the email attachment or link that you'd sent to yourself.

    For example, protected emails show in your regular email mobile app as attachments. 

1. When prompted to select an app to open the protected email or file, select the **AIP Viewer** app.

1. Sign in or select a certificate, as prompted. 

    Once authenticated, the AIP Viewer app displays the email or file for you.

> [!NOTE]
> Always open the AIP app by opening protected content. Do not try to sign in to the app until you're prompted, or open a protected file from inside the AIP Viewer app.
