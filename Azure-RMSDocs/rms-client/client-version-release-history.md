# Azure Information Protection client: Version release history and support policy


>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012*
>
> *Instructions for: [Azure Information Protection client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients)*

>[!NOTE] 
> To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, **Azure Information Protection client (classic)** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

> [!TIP]
> Interested in using the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client because your labels are published from the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Microsoft 365 security center, or Microsoft 365 compliance center? When you download and then install the unified labeling client from the Microsoft Download Center, you can upgrade your Azure Information Protection client to the [unified labeling client](unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md).

**To deploy the AIP classic client,** open a support ticket to get download access.

For more information, see [Upgrading and maintaining the Azure Information Protection client](client-admin-guide.md#upgrading-and-maintaining-the-azure-information-protection-client).

### Servicing information and timelines

Each general availability (GA) version of the Azure Information Protection client is supported for up to six months after the release of the subsequent GA version. With the exception of this section, the documentation does not include information about unsupported versions of the client. Fixes and new functionality are always applied to the latest GA version and will not be applied to older GA versions.

##### General availability versions that are no longer supported:

|1.41.51.0|11/27/2018|
|1.37.19.0|09/17/2018|
|1.29.5.0|06/26/2018|

The date format used on this page is *month/day/year*.

Starting 6/2/2019, the labeling service for Azure Information Protection requires connections that use TLS 1.2.

All client versions from 1.4.21.0 released 03/15/2017 support TLS 1.2. Client versions **1.3.155.2**, **1.2.4.0**, and **1.1.23.0** do not use TLS 1.2 and therefore can no longer download the Azure Information Protection policy.
