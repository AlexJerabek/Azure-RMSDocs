# Azure Information Protection client for Windows

>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012**

> *Instructions for: [Azure Information Protection client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients)*

>[!NOTE] 
> To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, **Azure Information Protection client (classic)** and **Label Management** in the Azure Portal are being **deprecated** as of **March 31, 2021**. This time-frame allows all current Azure Information Protection customers to transition to our unified labeling solution using the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform. Learn more in the official [deprecation notice](https://aka.ms/aipclassicsunset).

The Azure Information Protection client (classic) is the original downloadable client for organizations that use [Azure Information Protection](../what-is-information-protection.md) to classify and protect documents and emails, or use a Rights Management service to protect their data. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> This client, also known as the classic client, is being replaced by the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client. If you're not sure which client to use, see [Choose which labeling client to use for Windows computers](use-client.md#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use-for-windows-computers).

Use the following resources for the classic client:

- [Azure Information Protection client: Version release history](client-version-release-history.md)

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection user guide](client-user-guide.md)

> [!TIP]
> There's also an Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android. For more information, see [FAQs for Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](mobile-app-faq.md )
> 
> For Mac computers: Use the RMS sharing app and read the [FAQ for Rights Management Sharing Application for Mobile and Mac Platforms](https://technet.microsoft.com/dn451248).
