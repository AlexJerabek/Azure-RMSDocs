The Azure Information Protection classic client is the original downloadable client for organizations that use Azure Information Protection to classify and protect documents and emails, or use a Rights Management service to protect their data. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

Use the following resources for the classic client:

- [Azure Information Protection client: Version release history](client-version-release-history.md)

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection user guide](client-user-guide.md)

> [!TIP]
> There's also an Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android. For more information, see [FAQs for Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](mobile-app-faq.md )
> 
> For Mac computers: Use the RMS sharing app and read the [FAQ for Rights Management Sharing Application for Mobile and Mac Platforms](/previous-versions/msdn10/dn451248(v=msdn.10)).
