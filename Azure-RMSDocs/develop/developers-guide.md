# Azure Information Protection Developer's Guide

This guide will orient you to tools for extending and integrating with Azure Information Protectionâ€™s rights management service.

>The current Azure Information Protection SDK has the rights management component. A classification and labeling component are under development.

## Service Applications

Service applications provide capabilities to protect information when exporting from an enterprise content management system, a business application, or a cloud-based business solution. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Cloud Application Security (CAS) applications are examples of service applications. Our SDK for developing service applications is available through two programming models.

- [C++](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=38397)
- [C# Managed API](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/IpcManagedAPI)

### Examples of service applications

- [IpcDlp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample RMS-enabled DLP application that takes you through the basic steps that a DLP RMS-enabled application should perform by using the RMS File API for protecting and consuming restricted content.
- [IpcAzureApp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample that demonstrates how to use RMS SDK in Azure applications to protect data in an Azure Blob Storage.
- [RmsFileWatcher](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample that demonstrates how to build a Windows application that watches directories in the file system and applies RMS protection policies on every change, for example file added or file modified.
- [ProtectFilesInDir](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/ProtectFilesInDir) is a simple console application sample that takes a directory as input and protects all the files in that directory only, no recursion.

## PowerShell guides

Used by Azure Rights management administrators, PowerShell cmdlets are also useful for developing and testing your service applications. For more information, see [Using PowerShell with the Azure Information Protection client](../rms-client/client-admin-guide-powershell.md).

## User applications

User applications can be built with either the RMS SDK 2.1 or the RMS SDK 4.2.
The 4.2 version is REST client based with operating system specific APIs for several popular OSs; iOS/OSX, Android, Linux, Windows. The 2.1 version is used for building native Windows-based applications.

### User application development guides

- [Developing your application](developing-your-application.md)
- [Testing your application](how-to-set-up-your-test-environment.md)
- [Deploying your application](deploying-your-application.md)

### User application samples

- [AzureIP Test](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/AzureIP_Test) is a sample console application that allows you to encrypt documents with an Azure template or an ad-hoc policy.
- [IPCNotepad](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/AzureIP_Test) is a sample RMS-enabled application that takes you through the basic steps each RMS-enabled application should perform when protecting and consuming restricted content.
- [RmsDocumentInspector](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a tool can give information about any RMS protected file such as content-id or user rights.

## Development environment setup

The following guides lead you through OS specific setup steps for an application development environment using common tools.

[![iOS/OSX setup](../media/develop/ios-icon.png)](ios-sdk.md)
[![Android setup](../media/develop/android-icon.png)](android-sdk.md)
[![Windows Phone setup](../media/develop/windows-phone-icon.png)](windows-phone-apps.md)

[![Linux setup](../media/develop/linux-icon.png)](linux-setup.md)


## How-tos

Each of the following topics presents specific guidance for an aspect of implementing your application. Service applications are built using the RMS SDK 2.x. User applications are built using RMS SDK 4.x. The article link is attributed with the application type; service, user.
