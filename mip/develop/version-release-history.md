# Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) Software Development Kit (SDK) version release history and support policy

## Servicing

Each general availability (GA) version is supported for six months once the next GA version is released. The documentation may not include information about unsupported versions. Fixes and new functionality are only applied to the latest GA version.

Preview versions shouldn't be deployed in production. Instead, use the latest preview version to test new functionality or fixes that are coming in the next GA version. Only the most current preview version is supported.

## Release history

Use the following information to see whatâ€™s new or changed for a supported release. The most current release is listed first.

> [!NOTE]
> Minor fixes are not listed so if you experience a problem with the SDK, we recommend that you check whether it is fixed with the latest GA release. If the problem remains, check the current preview version.
>

## Version 1.6.103

**Release date**: April 16, 2020

### General SDK Changes

- TLS 1.2 enforced for all non-ADRMS HTTP communication.
- Migrated iOS/MacOS HTTP implementation from NSURLConnection to NSURLSession.
- Migrated iOS telemetry component from Aria SDK to 1DS SDK.
- Telemetry component now uses MIP's HttpDelegate on iOS, MacOs, and Linux. (Previously only win32).
- Improved type safety for C API.
- Moved AuthDelegate from Profile to Engine in C++, C#, and Java APIs.
- AuthDelegate moved from constructor of `Profile::Settings` to `Engine::Settings`.
- Added Category to NoPolicyError to provide more info about why policy sync failed.
- Added `PolicyEngine::GetTenantId` method.
- Added explicit sovereign cloud support.

- Enabled bitcode for iOS binaries.

### File SDK

- Added `IFileHandler::InspectAsync` to C# and Java Wrappers
- New support via `FileProfile::AcquirePolicyAuthToken` for triggering policy token acquisition to allow an application to warm up its token cache.    
- `MsgInspector::GetAttachments` returns `vector<shared_ptr<MsgAttachmentData>>` instead of `vector<unique_ptr<MsgAttachmentData>>`
- `TelemetryConfiguration::isOptedOut` setting now completely disables telemetry. Previously a set of minimum telemetry was sent.

### Policy SDK

- HYOK labels are filtered by default.
- Metadata associated with deleted labels will now be removed.
- If there is ever a mismatch between cached label policy and sensitivity policy, the policy cache will now be cleared.
- New support for versioned metadata:
  - A file format may rev the location/format of its label metadata. In that case, an application should provide MIP with all metadata, and MIP will determine which metadata is "true".
  - `ContentLabel::GetExtendedProperties` now returns `vector<MetadataEntry>` instead of `vector<pair<string, string>>`.
  - `MetadataAction::GetMetadataToAdd` now returns `vector<MetadataEntry>` instead of `vector<pair<string, string>>`.

  - `PolicyEngine::GetWxpMetadataVersion` returns the metadata version for Office documents as configured by tenant admin (0 = default, 1 = coauth-enabled format).
  - Equivalent changes in C API:
    - `MIP_CC_ContentLabel_GetExtendedProperties`
    - `MIP_CC_MetadataAction_GetMetadataToAdd`
    - `mip_cc_metadata_callback`
    - `mip_cc_document_state`
    - `MIP_CC_PolicyEngine_GetWxpMetadataVersion`

- New support for generating a pre-license when publishing.
- Exposed public Microsoft SSL cert used by protection service.
   - `GetMsftCert` and `GetMsftCertPEM`
   - If an application overrides `HttpDelegate` interface, it must trust server certificates issued by this CA.
