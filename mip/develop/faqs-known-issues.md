# Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) SDK FAQs and issues

This article provides answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and troubleshooting guidance for known issues and common errors.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### SDK string handling

**Question**: How does the SDK handle strings, and what string type should I be using in my code?

The SDK is intended to be used cross-platform, and uses [UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) for string handling. Specific guidance depends on the platform you're using:

| Platform | Guidance |
|-|-|
| Windows native | For C++ SDK clients, the C++ Standard Library type [`std::string`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_string_handling) is used for passing strings to/from API functions. Conversion to/from UTF-8 is managed internally by the MIP SDK. When a `std::string` is returned from an API, you must expect UTF-8 encoding and manage accordingly if converting the string. In some cases, a string is returned as part of a `uint8_t` vector (such as a publishing license (PL)), but should be treated as an opaque blob.<br><br>For more information and examples, see:<ul><li>[WideCharToMultiByte function](/windows/desktop/api/stringapiset/nf-stringapiset-widechartomultibyte) for assistance with converting wide character strings to multi-byte, such as UTF-8.<li>The following sample files included in the [SDK download](setup-configure-mip.md#configure-your-client-workstation):<ul><li>Sample string utility functions in `file\samples\common\string_utils.cpp`, for converting to/from wide UTF-8 strings.<li>An implementation of `wmain(int argc, wchar_t *argv[])` in `file\samples\file\main.cpp`, which uses the preceding string conversion functions.</li></ul></ul>|
| .NET | For .NET SDK clients, all strings use the default UTF-16 encoding and no special conversion is needed. Conversion to/from UTF-16 is managed internally by the MIP SDK. |
| Other platforms | All other platforms supported by the MIP SDK have native support for UTF-8. |

## Issues and errors reference

### Error: "File format not supported"  

**Question**: Why do I get the following error when attempting to protect or label a PDF file?

> File format not supported

This exception results from attempting to protect or label a PDF file that has been digitally signed or password protected. See [New support for PDF encryption with Microsoft Information Protection](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Information-Protection/New-support-for-PDF-encryption-with-Microsoft-Information/ba-p/262757) for more information on protecting and labeling PDF files.

### Error: "Failed to parse the acquired Compliance Policy"  

**Question**: Why do I get the following error after downloading the MIP SDK and attempting to use the file sample to list all labels?

> Something bad happened: Failed to parse the acquired Compliance Policy. Failed with: [class mip::CompliancePolicyParserException] Tag not found: policy, NodeType: 15, Name: No Name Found, Value: , Ancestors: <SyncFile><Content>, correlationId:[34668a40-blll-4ef8-b2af-00005aa674z9]

This indicates that you haven't migrated your labels from Azure Information Protection to the unified labeling experience. Follow [How to migrate Azure Information Protection labels to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels) to migrate the labels, then create a Label Policy in Office 365 Security and Compliance Center. 

### Error: "NoPolicyException: Label policy did not contain data"

**Question**: Why do I get the following error when trying to read a label or list labels via MIP SDK?

> NoPolicyException: Label policy did not contain data, CorrelationId=GUID, CorrelationId.Description=PolicyProfile, NoPolicyError.Category=SyncFile, NoPolicyError.Category=SyncFile

This indicates that no labeling policy has been published in Microsoft Security and Compliance Center. Follow [Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels) to configure the labeling policy.

### Error: "System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: LoadLibrary failed"

**Question**: Why do I get the following error when using the MIP SDK .NET Wrapper?

> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: LoadLibrary failed for: [sdk_wrapper_dotnet.dll] when calling MIP.Initialize().

Your application does not have the required runtime, or was not built as Release. See [Ensure your app has the required runtime](setup-configure-mip.md#ensure-your-app-has-the-required-runtime) for more information. 

### Error: "ProxyAuthError exception"

**Question**: Why do I get the following error when using the MIP SDK?

> "ProxyAuthenticatonError: Proxy authentication is unsupported"

The MIP SDK doesn't support the use of authenticated proxies. To fix this message, proxy administrators should set the Microsoft Information Protection service endpoints to bypass the proxy. A list of those endpoints are available at the [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges) page. MIP SDK requires that `*.protection.outlook.com` (row 9) and the Azure Information Protection service endpoints (row 73) bypass proxy authentication.

### Issues in .NET Core

**Question**: Does the NuGet package work in .NET Core? 

The NuGet package will install to a .NET Core project, but will fail to run. We're working on fixing this for Windows, but don't currently have a timeline to support other platforms.
